        and is sure to please!</p>
    <h3 class="header subheader">fixings</h3>
    <ul class="text">
        <li>2 cups slivered blanched almonds</li>
        <li>2-3 tsp nutritional yeast (plus more to taste)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2-3/4 tsp sea salt</li>
        <li>1 dash garlic powder</li>
        <li>3/4-1 cup water</li>
        <li>2-3 Tbsp fresh basil, oregano, or parsley (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="header subheader">make it happen</h3>
    <ol class="text">
        <li>Add all ricotta ingredients (starting with the lesser amounts of water and salt) to a high-speed blender
            (such as a Vitamix) and blend until smooth and creamy, scraping down sides as needed (~2 minutes). You are
            looking for a well-puréed mixture with only very small bits of almonds intact. Add a bit more water a little
            at a time if the mixture is having a hard time blending until smooth.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more salt for overall flavor, nutritional yeast for cheesiness,
            and lemon juice for acidity. For even more flavor, you can add in some fresh basil, oregano, or parsley
            (optional).</li>
        <li>Enjoy! Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 5-7 days.</li>
    </ol>
