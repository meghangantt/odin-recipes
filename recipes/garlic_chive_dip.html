    <h3 class="header subheader">the details</h3>
    <p class="text">This garlic and chive dip is perfect for a crowd. Its base is an <a href="./almond_ricotta.html">almond "ricotta</a>," which requires just minutes to
        make. From there, it's as easy as mincing some garlic, juicing a lemon, and heating the oven. Just be sure to
        include a "Contains Nuts" sign, otherwise your crowd will think it's made with dairy!</p>
