    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This garlic and chive dip is perfect for a crowd. Its base is an almond "ricotta," which requires just minutes to
        make. From there, it's as easy as mincing some garlic, juicing a lemon, and heating the oven. Just be sure to
        include a "Contains Nuts" sign, otherwise your crowd will think it's made with dairy!</p>
