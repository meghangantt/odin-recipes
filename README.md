Oden Projectâ€“Create a basic website showcasing three recipes

This project was completed as part of the Odin Project curriculum. While the original project description called for very basic HTML and CSS, I opted to enhance it with several design features, most notably its flexbox properties.

Because I created this site for learning purposes only, much of the actual content of the recipes themselves is not my own. The content creators I adapted the site content from are credited below:
